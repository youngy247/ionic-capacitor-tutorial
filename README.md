# InsectInspect

What started as a curoisity for Ionic and Capacitor following the freeCodeCamp tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7ghUiXLef8 grew into InsectInspect

Where you can view observations of Plants and Animals and see the exact pinpoint of the sighting all around the globe. 

The app also uses Firebase, Firestore and Firestorage for you to have your own account to upload your own observations with pinpoints of where your sightings took place
